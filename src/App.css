/**
 * App.css
 *
 * This file is kept for any app-specific custom CSS that doesn't fit
 * into Tailwind's utility-first approach.
 *
 * TAILWIND BEST PRACTICE:
 * - Use Tailwind utilities directly in your components (className="...")
 * - Only add custom CSS here for things Tailwind can't do easily
 *   (complex animations, third-party library overrides, etc.)
 *
 * For now, this file is mostly empty because we'll style with Tailwind utilities.
